	        <p style ="font-size:2vw;" > I am a computer science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My passions lie in the intersection of art and technology. I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast and it is evident by my academic path. My first encounter with artificial intelligence reading "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." It established a very clear idea that perhaps the issues that plague society could be solved with artificial intelligence as it would bypass biases. Being at the front another upcoming tech era is something I am passionate about.</p>
